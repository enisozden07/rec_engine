## Overview

This project implements a recommendation backend for retail/e-commerce businesses. It uses sequential recommendation models (SSEPT) to analyze customer purchase patterns and predict future product interests based on loyalty program data.

---

## Features

- **Self-Supervised Sequential Recommendation (SSEPT)**  
- **FastAPI**-powered REST API for fetching recommendations  
- Modular design: separate environments for model training vs. API service  
- Jupyter notebooks for experimenting with and extending the model

## Installation

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd loyalty-recom
````

### 2. Create Conda Environments

```bash
# Environment for model training
conda create -n recommendation python=3.9

# Environment for API service
conda create -n api python=3.9
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# For model training
conda activate recommendation
pip install -r requirements-model.txt

# For running the API
conda activate api
pip install -r requirements-api.txt
```

---

## Usage

### Training Models

1. Activate your training environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate recommendation
   ```

2. Launch Jupyter Lab to explore & train:

   ```bash
   cd notebooks/model_development
   jupyter lab
   ```

3. Follow the SSEPT notebook to preprocess data, train the model, and export your checkpoint(s) into `models/`.

---

### Running the API

1. Activate your API environment:

   ```bash
   conda activate api
   ```

2. Start the FastAPI server:

   ```bash
   uvicorn api.app:app --reload --port 8000
   ```

3. The API is now live at `http://localhost:8000`.
